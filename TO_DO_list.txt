(July 31th 2013)
- (DONE) Transfer the project state from "BETA" to "RELEASE CANDIDATE"
- (DONE) Offer a high level testbench in assembler for testing all Op Codes
         Including Klaus Dormann's "65c02_*_test" suite
- (DONE) Because of translation errors the Verilog sources are no longer
         available
- (DONE) Create "golden" simulation files for Modelsim/QuestaSim
- (75%)  Finish working for Specification of cpu65C02_tc
- (85%)  Finish working for Specification of cpu65C02_tc


(February 25th 2009)
- (DONE) CORRECTED "RTI" (wrong: use of stack pointer)
- (DONE) CORRECTED "RMBx" & "SMBx" (wrong: bit translation)
- (DONE) RENAME all states of "FSM Execution Unit" for better reading
- (85%) Finish working for Specification of cpu65C02_tc
- (DONE) CORRECT timing for addressing mode "ABS,X" for "INC" (wrong: 6 cycles
         instead of 7)
- (DONE) OPTIMIZE end states of "STA" (s197,s207,s200,s213)

(January, 4th 2009)
- (DONE) Remove unused nets, register and modules
- (DONE) Update the HDL Designer files for better viewing and
  understanding
  
(August, 5th 2008)
- (DONE) Rename all port names (_i, _o, _o_i)
- (DONE) Test and verify all Op Codes
- (DONE) Optimize core for speed
- (DONE) Implement same improvements like cpu6502_tc (graphical design, source
  utilisation...)
- (75%) Finish working for Specification of cpu65C02_tc
- (WORKING) Create high level testbench in assembler and hardware for 
  testing all Op Codes (include accurate cycle timing)
- (WORKING) Create simulation files for Modelsim
- (WORKING) Create a simple .wlf file to demonstrate the cpu65C02_tc
- Update the HDL Designer files for better viewing and understanding
